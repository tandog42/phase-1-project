## ðŸ“˜ Project Overview

Using an open API that consists of Coronavirus cases. I was able to create a single-page application (SPA) that allows you to enter any country of your choosing. When you click search it will then display the country you chose and the coronavirus statistics about that country. I added a back button that will bring you back to the homepage to search for another country!
